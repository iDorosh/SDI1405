<p>The reason I chose to make my story about a rocket launch is because I recently read a book about space called "The Martian". I thought that it was an amazing book and realized since the rockets are very complex they require a lot of steps to launch.</p>
<p>In my story I simplified the basic rocket launch to fit the flow chart as best I could. Getting user information about when to launch the rocket and the wind conditions allowed me to calculate the amount of seconds to add to the count down and how much money to spend on fuel.</p>
